# playwright-python
A comprehensive docker image to run Playwright Python for RPA in headless mode.

This docker image contains Python with Playwright, Flask and psycopg2 modules.

Playwright is installed with the [chrome headless
shell](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell).

There is no `latest` version of this container, pull exact versions instead.
Eg. `docker pull rsubr/playwright-python:1.49.1`.
